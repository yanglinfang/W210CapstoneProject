        "claim": "The process of claim 1 wherein the amount of polycarboxylic acid employed in the initial charge is equal to between 6 to 12 weight percent in excess of stoichiometry. 4. The process of claim 1 wherein the polyhydric alcohol is selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butane diol and mixtures thereof. 1. In a process for the preparation of a polyester polyol by the esterification of a polycarboxylic acid or anhydride with a polyhydric alcohol the improvement which comprises:a. initially charging to a reactor an amount of a polycarboxylic acid or anhydride equal to between 3 to 16 weight percent in excess of stoichiometry;b. adding to the reactor a polyhydric alcohol and heating the charge to a temperature between 130.degree. to 240.degree. C.;c. removing from the reactor between 90 to 95 weight percent of the water of esterification resulting from step (b);d. charging to the reactor an amount of polyhydric alcohol substantially equivalent in weight to the amount of water of esterification removed from step (c); ande. continuing the esterification reaction until a polyol having an acid number of less than two is obtained.",
